# MLSecOps Threat Model: Banking Fraud Detection System

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a comprehensive threat model for a machine learning-based fraud detection system used in banking operations. The system processes credit card transactions in real-time to identify potentially fraudulent activities.

### Key Findings
- **High Risk Threats:** Data poisoning, adversarial evasion, model extraction
- **Business Impact:** $10M+ potential annual fraud losses without proper controls
- **Investment Required:** $2M in security controls vs. $50M+ risk exposure
- **Compliance:** PCI DSS, SOX, GDPR requirements

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run threat validation
python automation/threat-validation.py

# Generate reports
python automation/reporting.py
```
## Repository Structure
- `threat-model/` - Core threat analysis and security controls
- `automation/` - Automated validation and testing scripts
- `docs/` - Methodology and business impact analysis
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD integration for continuous threat modeling

## Methodology
Based on STRIDE framework with ML-specific extensions using OWASP Top 10 ML and MITRE ATT&CK for ML systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Required packages: `pyyaml`, `pandas`, `numpy`

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlsecops-threat-model.git
cd mlsecops-threat-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
#### Run Threat Validation
```bash
python automation/threat-validation.py
```
This validates the threat model structure and identifies coverage gaps.

#### Test Security Controls
```bash
python automation/control-testing.py
```
This tests the effectiveness of implemented security controls.

#### Generate Reports
```bash
python automation/reporting.py
```
This generates executive summaries and technical reports.

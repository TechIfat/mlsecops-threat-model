# MLSecOps Threat Modeling Methodology

## Overview
This document describes the methodology used for threat modeling of ML-based systems, specifically tailored for the banking fraud detection use case.

## Frameworks Used

### 1. STRIDE Framework
- **Spoofing**: Impersonating legitimate users or systems
- **Tampering**: Modifying data or code
- **Repudiation**: Denying actions or transactions
- **Information Disclosure**: Exposing sensitive information
- **Denial of Service**: Preventing system availability
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining unauthorized access

### 2. ML-Specific Extensions
- **OWASP Top 10 for LLMs**: Adapted for ML systems
- **MITRE ATT&CK for ML**: Machine learning attack techniques
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework**: Governance and compliance

## Threat Modeling Process

### Phase 1: System Architecture Analysis
1. **Decompose the system** into components
2. **Identify data flows** and trust boundaries
3. **Map attack surfaces** and entry points
4. **Document assumptions** and dependencies

### Phase 2: Threat Identification
1. **Apply STRIDE categories** to each component
2. **Consider ML-specific threats** (poisoning, evasion, extraction)
3. **Analyze attack vectors** and techniques
4. **Assess threat actors** and motivations

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment
1. **Evaluate likelihood** of each threat
2. **Assess business impact** of successful attacks
3. **Calculate risk scores** using standardized matrix
4. **Prioritize threats** based on risk level

### Phase 4: Control Design
1. **Identify existing controls** and their effectiveness
2. **Design new controls** to address gaps
3. **Evaluate control effectiveness** and cost
4. **Create implementation roadmap**

### Phase 5: Validation and Testing
1. **Validate threat model** completeness
2. **Test security controls** effectiveness
3. **Perform gap analysis** and updates
4. **Generate reports** and recommendations

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Priority |
|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| High | High | 9 | Critical |
| High | Medium | 6 | High |
| High | Low | 3 | Medium |
| Medium | High | 6 | High |
| Medium | Medium | 4 | Medium |
| Medium | Low | 2 | Low |
| Low | High | 3 | Medium |
| Low | Medium | 2 | Low |
| Low | Low | 1 | Low |
